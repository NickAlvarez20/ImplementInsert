## Project Name
Implement Insert
## About
This project implements an insertion algorithm in JavaScript, designed to insert a value into a sorted array while maintaining the array's sorted order. It serves as a practical exercise to understand the mechanics of insertion operations, a key component of algorithms like insertion sort.
## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need a JavaScript runtime environment (e.g., Node.js) installed on your system. No additional libraries are required.
## Features
This ImplementInsert includes these features:

-Insertion algorithm to place a value into a sorted array

-In-place array manipulation to shift elements

-Support for multiple sequential insertions

-Built-in assertions to verify correct array state after insertions

## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine: 

`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/ImplementInsert.git`
## Usage
Run the JavaScript script (insertion_algo.js) from the command line using Node.js: 

`node insertion_algo.js`
## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:

-Understand the logic of insertion algorithms and their role in sorting

-Gain proficiency in JavaScript array manipulation and loop constructs

-Practice implementing in-place modifications with minimal memory overhead

-Develop skills in writing assertion-based tests for algorithm verification
